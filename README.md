# Work-Day-Scheduler
Simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.

## Description
This project is a simple application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. It uses the Day.js library to work with date and time.

## User Story
As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively.

## Features
The application has several features designed to enhance the user experience and functionality. These features collectively provide a comprehensive tool for managing daily events, helping users to stay organized and productive.

### Current Day Display
The application displays the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner. This feature provides a quick reference for the user to know the date they are currently planning events for.
### Time Blocks 
The application presents time blocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down. These time blocks allow the user to easily see and plan events for each hour of the day.
### Event Input
Users can enter an event when they click a time block. This feature enables the user to input details about their scheduled activities for each hour.
### Local Storage
Events saved by the user are stored locally. This means that even after refreshing the page, the user's events remain intact. This feature ensures that the user's scheduling efforts are preserved across sessions.
### Color-Coding
Each time block is color-coded based on whether it represents a past, present, or future time block. This visual aid helps the user to quickly identify their current time block and those that are yet to come.

## Usage
When you open the application, you will see the current day displayed at the top of the calendar. You can scroll down to see the time blocks for the standard business hours. Each time block can be clicked to enter an event. When you're done entering the event, click the save button to save the event in local storage. Refreshing the page will persist the saved events.
